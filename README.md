# Linkwarden API

A Rust app for auto-labelling links in [Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app/) using any [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) compatible APIs (works with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)).

*THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS...*

## Next steps

This is a list of features I would like to implement:

- [ ] Add an option to perform tagging on non-tagged links only or all.
- [ ] Allow to select the language for tags.
- [ ] Add support for more AI models (e.g. GPT-3, BLOOM, etc.)
- [ ] Customize prompts.
- [ ] Temperature control for prompts.
